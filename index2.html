        Headlines would have you believe that millennials are destroying industries from cereal to soap (with the possible exception of their beloved avocados). But these 22- to -37-year-olds—plus their under-22 successors, known as Generation Z, Generation Y, or post millennials, depending on whom you ask—are as excited about fashion as ever. They just think about it differently.
        To put it simply: Fashion 1.0 was all about runway shows; you’d wait months for the collections to arrive in stores. The new iteration works on a more spontaneous timeline of streetwear-influenced “drops,” limited editions, and impromptu collaborations. The clothes look different, too.

        At this past Milan Fashion Week, Moncler unveiled its Genius project, a series of collaborations with young labels, including Palm Angels and Craig Green, in an Instagram-friendly setting. Then there’s Off-White impresario—and recently appointed Louis Vuitton menswear designer—Virgil Abloh, who might be the prototypical Gen-Z designer. His collaborations span everyone from IKEA to artist Takashi Murakami, and his most recent Paris Fashion Week show attracted throngs of fans outside. Abloh’s pace might seem frenetic to designers of an older generation, but his gig-economy approach keeps his followers interested. He compares it to the way he shuffles between tracks as a DJ: “litmus-testing the culture.”
        As Hernandez puts it, “People get bored of things more quickly now. 
        Instead of expecting a collection to be relevant for six months, 
        it’s two months.” Customers have to move quickly, too, or risk 
        missing that precious PSWL drop: “If you don’t get it now, you might 
        never get it.”
