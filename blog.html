        <span id="longText">Headlines would have you believe that millennials are destroying industries from cereal to soap (with the possible exception of their beloved avocados). 
        But these 22- to -37-year-olds—plus their under-22 successors, known as Generation Z, Generation Y, or post millennials, depending on whom you ask—are as excited about fashion as ever.

        <span hidden id="shortText" style="display:inline;">think about it differently. To put it simply: Fashion 1.0 was all about runway shows; you’d 
        wait months for the collections to arrive in stores. The new iteration works on a more spontaneous timeline of streetwear-influenced “drops,” 
        limited editions, and impromptu collaborations. The clothes look different, too.</span>

        <span id="longtext"> At this past Milan Fashion Week, Moncler unveiled its Genius project, a series of collaborations with young labels, including Palm Angels and Craig Green, 
        in an Instagram-friendly setting. Then there’s Off-White impresario—and recently appointed Louis Vuitton menswear designer—Virgil Abloh, who might be the prototypical 
        Gen-Z designer. His collaborations span everyone from IKEA to artist Takashi Murakami, and his most recent Paris Fashion Week show attracted throngs of fans outside.

        the way he shuffles between tracks as a DJ: “litmus-testing the culture.” As Hernandez puts it, “People get bored of things more quickly now. 
        Instead of expecting a collection to be relevant for six months, it’s two months.” Customers have to move quickly, too, or risk 
        missing that precious PSWL drop: “If you don’t get it now, you might never get it.”
